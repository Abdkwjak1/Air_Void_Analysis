## TO Do list
This md file is for listing the steps to proceed with

### First Stage:
1.	Calculating the porosity ratio (pores areas regarding to the original area) along x-axis .
2.	Calculating the porosity ratio (pores areas regarding to the original area) along z-axis . 
3.	Calculating the porosity ratio (pores areas regarding to the original area) along y-axis . 
4.	Drawing diagrams represents the porosity in each axis.


### Second Stage:
1. Distance between pores across 3 dimensions.
2. Calculate the distance factor.
